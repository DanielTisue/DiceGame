Simple and fun game to help with learning JavaScript!

# OBJECT:

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. Each players goal is to reach 100 points in order to win. Each player gets limitless rolls, but only accumulates points by holding the points from the previous roll. If the player decides to do this then the turn goes to the next player. If either player rolls a 1 then they forfeit their turn to the other player and only maintain the points they held the previous turn.
